<h1>Plugin : Cache</h1>

### About
Store [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) caches in a file so you won't lose them whenevever you restart the bot. Currently modmail.js only store some 
of discord.js's cache meaning that you can't do anything with that, but you can use this plugin with another plugin [ReplyToReply](https://modmail.js.org/plugins/replytoreply).

 ### Setup
 
```js
plugins: [{
 cache: './FileName.json',
}]
```
